\ **Open** \ Generation, \ Storage, \ and \ **T**\ransmission Operation and \ **E**\xpansion \ **P**\lanning Model with RES and \ **ES**\S (**openTEPES**)

“*Simplicity and Transparency in Energy Systems Planning*”

The **openTEPES** model has been developed at the `Instituto de Investigación Tecnológica (IIT) <https://www.iit.comillas.edu/index.php.en>`_ of the `Universidad Pontificia Comillas <https://www.comillas.edu/en/>`_.

The **openTEPES** model presents a decision support system for defining the integrated generation, storage, and transmission expansion plan (GEP+SEP+TEP) -**Integrated Resource Planning** (IRP)- of a **large-scale electric system** at a tactical level (i.e., time horizons of 5-30 years),
defined as a set of **generation, storage, and (electricity, hydrogen, and heat) networks dynamic investment decisions for multiple future years**.

It is integrated into the `open energy system modelling platform <https://openenergymodels.net/>`_, helping model Europe's energy system and in the list of `energy models published under open source licenses <https://wiki.openmod-initiative.org/wiki/Open_Models>`_.
It is also part of the Africa `open energy system modelling toolbox <https://africaenergymodels.net/>`_, which is a suite of open and linked state-of-the-art open-source energy system models for Africa.

Scripts are provided to exchange information with Integrated Assessment Models (IAM) using their `nomenclature and data formats <https://nomenclature-iamc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.

It has been used by the **Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (MITECO)** to analyze the electricity sector in the latest Spanish `National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) Update 2023-2030 <https://www.miteco.gob.es/content/dam/miteco/es/energia/files-1/pniec-2023-2030/PNIEC_2024_240924.pdf>`_ in September 2024.
